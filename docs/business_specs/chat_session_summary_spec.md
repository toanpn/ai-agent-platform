# Chat Session Summary - Business Specification

## 1. Introduction

Currently, chat sessions are identified by generic names like "Session_1", "Session_2". This makes it difficult for users to distinguish between different conversations. This feature introduces automatic session summarization to provide meaningful titles for chat sessions, improving user experience and navigability.

## 2. User Stories

*   **As a user,** I want to see a concise summary of my chat session in the session list so that I can easily identify and revisit past conversations.
*   **As a user,** I want the session title to be automatically updated as the conversation progresses so that it always reflects the current context of the chat.
*   **As a user,** I don't want to be distracted by frequent title changes, so the summary should only be generated periodically.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   The chat session title should be automatically generated based on the content of the conversation.
*   The summary generation should be triggered after every 5 messages in a chat session.
*   The generated summary should be used as the display title for the session in the chat sidebar.
*   The summary should be concise, ideally a short sentence or a few keywords.
*   The summarization process should not block the user interface or degrade chat performance. It should run as a background process.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The summarization process should be efficient and not introduce noticeable latency to the user.
*   **Accuracy:** The summary should accurately reflect the main topics of the conversation.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should scale to handle many concurrent chat sessions.

## 5. Out of Scope

*   Manual editing of session titles by the user.
*   On-demand summarization triggered by the user.
*   Summarization of sessions from previous application versions (summaries will be generated for new conversations only).
