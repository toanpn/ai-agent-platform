# Chat System Business Specification

## Overview

The Chat System is the primary interface for users to interact with AI agents in the AI Agent Platform. It provides a conversational experience where users can ask questions, request tasks, and receive intelligent responses from a network of specialized AI agents.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Seamless Agent Interaction**: Enable users to communicate with AI agents through natural language without needing to understand the underlying complexity of the multi-agent system.

2. **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation history and context across multiple interactions to provide coherent and relevant responses.

3. **Transparency**: Provide visibility into which agents and tools were used to process requests, enhancing user trust and understanding.

4. **Scalability**: Support multiple concurrent conversations and users while maintaining performance and responsiveness.

### Key Success Metrics

- User engagement rates with the chat interface
- Response accuracy and relevance scores
- Average conversation length and depth
- User satisfaction with agent responses
- System response times and availability

## User Experience Requirements

### Usability Standards

1. **Response Time**: Chat responses should be delivered within 10 seconds for 95% of requests
2. **Availability**: System should maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours
3. **Accessibility**: Interface must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Chat interface must work effectively on mobile devices

### User Interface Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Chat interface should be clean and uncluttered
2. **Clarity**: Responses should be clearly attributed to specific agents
3. **Feedback**: Users should receive immediate feedback for their actions
4. **Context**: Conversation flow should be easy to follow and understand

## Business Rules

### Message Processing Rules

1. **Authentication Required**: All chat interactions require valid user authentication
