## Enhanced Fields Explanation

### `agentsUsed`
Array of agent names that were actually invoked during the request processing. This shows which specific agents handled the user's request.

### `toolsUsed` 
Array of tool names that were executed during processing. This provides insight into which specific tools were called to fulfill the request.

### `availableAgents`
Complete list of all agents available in the system with their descriptions. This helps clients understand what capabilities are available.

### `availableTools`
Complete list of all tools available in the system with their descriptions. This provides transparency about the system's capabilities.

### `executionDetails`
Detailed step-by-step execution trace showing:
- `totalSteps`: Number of execution steps performed
- `executionSteps`: Array of execution steps with:
  - `toolName`: Name of the tool/agent that was called
  - `toolInput`: Input provided to the tool/agent
  - `observation`: Response or output from the tool/agent

### `metadata`
Additional metadata about the request processing including timing information and error details.

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly which agents and tools were used
2. **Debugging**: Detailed execution steps help troubleshoot issues
3. **Discovery**: Available agents and tools help users understand system capabilities
4. **Monitoring**: Execution details enable performance monitoring and optimization
5. **Analytics**: Rich metadata supports usage analytics and improvement insights

## Backward Compatibility

The enhanced response maintains backward compatibility by preserving all original fields (`response`, `agentName`, `sessionId`, `timestamp`). Existing clients will continue to work while new clients can leverage the enhanced information.
