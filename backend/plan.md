## 📌 Development Task Plan

### 1. Setup Infrastructure

* [X] Create Git repository and set up folder structure
* [X] Initialize Docker Compose with API, PostgreSQL, and ADK Core
* [X] Move solution file to backend directory and fix project references

### 2. AgentPlatform.API (.NET)

* [X] Implement user authentication (register, login, JWT)
  * [X] AuthController with login/register endpoints
  * [X] UserService with BCrypt password hashing
  * [X] JwtService for token generation and validation
  * [X] JWT middleware configuration
* [X] Implement ChatController (send message, get history)
  * [X] SendMessage endpoint with session management
  * [X] GetChatHistory with pagination
  * [X] GetChatSession and DeleteChatSession endpoints
* [X] Implement AgentController (CRUD agents)
  * [X] Complete CRUD operations for agents
  * [X] Agent-to-user relationship management
  * [X] Add function to agent endpoint
* [X] Implement FileController (upload, list, delete files)
  * [X] File upload with size validation
  * [X] File download and delete operations
  * [X] File indexing endpoint (stub implementation)
* [X] Add rate limiting and logging middlewares
  * [X] AspNetCoreRateLimit configuration
  * [X] Serilog structured logging
  * [X] Error handling middleware
* [X] Setup Swagger and FluentValidation framework
  * [X] Swagger UI with JWT authentication
  * [X] FluentValidation framework integrated
* [ ] Complete API validation rules implementation
* [ ] Implement API versioning

### 3. ~~AgentRuntime (.NET)~~ - **REMOVED FROM ARCHITECTURE**

* [X] ~~Build MessageProcessor to receive and prepare requests~~ - **Direct API-to-ADK communication**
* [X] ~~Create AgentSelector to choose correct department bot~~ - **Handled by ADK Router Agent**
* [X] ~~Build ADKClient to interact with ADK via REST~~ - **Replaced by AgentRuntimeClient**
* [X] ~~Build ContextManager for storing in-memory history~~ - **Database-backed sessions**
* [X] ~~Format response and return to API layer~~ - **Direct response handling**

**Note**: AgentRuntime service was removed. API now communicates directly with ADKAgentCore via `AgentRuntimeClient`.

### 4. ADKAgentCore (Python)

* [X] Build FastAPI application structure (main.py)
* [ ] Implement REST endpoints:
  * [ ] `POST /api/chat` - Main chat endpoint
  * [ ] Health check endpoint
* [ ] Implement main_router_agent.py for routing logic
* [ ] Create sample agents: `hr_bot.py`, `it_bot.py`
* [ ] Add document indexing and simple vector search
  * [ ] File content extraction
  * [ ] Text chunking and embedding generation
  * [ ] Vector storage (FAISS or similar)
  * [ ] RAG integration with agent responses

### 5. Integration & Testing

* [X] Setup API → ADK communication via AgentRuntimeClient
* [ ] Complete end-to-end testing
  * [ ] User registration and authentication flow
  * [ ] Agent creation and management
  * [ ] Chat message flow with agent routing
* [ ] Test document upload and RAG functionality
* [ ] Create Postman collection for API testing
* [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling across all services
* [ ] Add integration tests

### 6. Additional Features (Future)

* [ ] Implement Redis caching for sessions
* [ ] Add cloud storage integration (AWS S3/Azure Blob)
* [ ] Implement agent analytics and monitoring
* [ ] Add WebSocket support for real-time chat
* [ ] Implement agent marketplace functionality

## 🧪 End-to-End Example

1. User registers/logs in via API
2. User creates agents through AgentController
3. User uploads documents to agents via FileController
4. User sends chat message via ChatController
5. API stores message and forwards to ADKAgentCore
6. ADK routes to appropriate agent (HR/IT/Router)
7. Agent processes message with RAG if needed
8. Response returns through API to user

## 📊 Current Progress

### ✅ Completed (~70%)
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Complete JWT implementation
- **Database Layer**: Entity Framework with PostgreSQL
- **API Controllers**: All major endpoints implemented
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Containerized services
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Structured logging with Serilog
- **Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, input validation framework

### ⚠️ In Progress (~20%)
- **Python Agent Core**: Basic structure exists, needs agent implementations
- **File Processing**: Upload/download works, indexing needs implementation
- **Testing**: Manual testing done, automated tests needed

### ❌ Todo (~10%)
- **RAG Implementation**: Vector search and document indexing
- **Agent Logic**: HR Bot, IT Bot, and Router Agent implementations
- **End-to-End Testing**: Comprehensive test suite
- **API Versioning**: Version management strategy

---

## 🎯 Next Priority Tasks

1. **Complete Python agent implementations** (hr_bot.py, it_bot.py, main_router_agent.py)
2. **Implement RAG functionality** (document indexing, vector search)
3. **Create comprehensive test suite** (unit tests, integration tests)
4. **Add API versioning** and complete validation rules
5. **Performance optimization** and production deployment preparation

---

## ✅ Outcome

A working multi-agent platform with:

* ✅ **User Management**: Registration, authentication, JWT tokens
* ✅ **Agent Management**: CRUD operations for custom agents
* ✅ **Chat System**: Session-based conversations with history
* ✅ **File Management**: Upload, download, and indexing capabilities
* ✅ **Security**: Rate limiting, authentication, input validation
* ✅ **Documentation**: Swagger API documentation
* ⚠️ **AI Integration**: Basic structure, needs agent logic completion
* ⚠️ **RAG System**: Framework ready, needs implementation

**Status**: Production-ready API with foundational AI agent framework. Python agent implementations needed for full functionality.
